This is my personal website.

Here I will demonstrate my \_~awesome\_~ programmatic capabilities through various personal projects.

The website itself will be barebones with the hopes of plugging in webapp capabilities such as Twitch, Youtube and various Webscraping.

My strength is in back-end, but this will be a fun excercise to dive into front end and appreciate a full stack process.
